Welcome to my blog! I'll be using this space to document and think out some aspects of my Capstone project for my MLS degree. My project consists of creating a digital edition of Tacitus' *Histories*. I am especially interested in integrating the critical apparatus in a way that makes it easier to use than in a traditional print edition. I am also working on creating disambiguated links to the people and places in the text. These are features that are so far lacking in other digital editions of the text.

[This is a link]("https://ayarnell.github.io/Z656/FinalProject/index.html") to the work I have done so far. As you can see, certain words are underlined. These words have different readings in different manuscripts, which become visible when you hover over the underlined word. A key to the manuscript abbreviations is found on the Sigla page.

Much of my work now is concerned with extracting the person and placenames from the text and assigning them unique ids. I will then work on linking these internal project ids to external authority references. Finally, I will be working on a way for users to explore the different locations and historical figures in the text.
